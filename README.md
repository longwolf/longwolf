- 👋 Hi, I’m @longwolf
- 👀 I’m interested in too much to list here, but mostly things that outlast time or affect the current moment
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to get through a human life span without causing too much damage
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on little helpers in the background that facilitate things just to work
- 📫 How to reach me ... I hope there is a built-in standard way here
